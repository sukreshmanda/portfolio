I’m a software engineer who loves digging under the hood—profiling React’s scheduling, reverse-engineering **.NET** and **Java** runtimes, and tracing every weird edge case I can find. And sometimes turn my experiments into quirky technical deep dives. If it’s tricky, niche, or makes other engineers scratch their heads, I’m probably already playing with it.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably watching movies/anime, playing badminton 🏸 or running 🏃‍➡️. You can checkout my photo clicking hobby too [@everything is wrong](https://www.instagram.com/wright_is_wrong)
